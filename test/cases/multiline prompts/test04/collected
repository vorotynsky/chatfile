[model] SYSTEM: Explain quantum computing.
[model] USER:
Quantum computing leverages
    quantum bits or qubits.
It performs complex calculations at unprecedented speeds.
[model] ASSISTANT:
Quantum computing uses qubits to process information
in ways classical computers cannot, enabling powerful computational capabilities.
